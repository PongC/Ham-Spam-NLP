Introduction

People receiving email everyday would have experienced the “bad mail” or “spam” before. The other type of an email or “good mail” is called “HAM”. This is a common term among anti-spam software developers, and is a term that we would use in our research also. We have dataset of spam and ham emails categorized separately. Therefore, it would be a good opportunity if we can determine which string indicates “HAM” or “SPAM”. For this, we will involve the processing of Natural Language Processing. In addition, we want to know which word(s) indicates spam and which indicates ham. To do so, we will find the frequency of the strings in each type of emails and to determine the main terms/strings used in spams or bad mails. With these, our project will include two processes, namely “Natural Language Processing” and “Data Science Processing”.
